    <p>I have been a chef for more than 20 years. I have worked in many different cities. I'm going to write a few
      stories about what
      happened in those places. I'm also a amateur photographer. On my <a href="https://martintendam.com"
        target="_blank">website</a> you can see a few of them.</p>

      Groningen is a city in the north of the Netherlands. It's the city I was born and raised in. It is here that I
      started working in professional kitchens.

      I was asked to become the private chef of the European Ambassador in Prague. I had to cook for the family and
      all
      the official entertainment being held at the residence.
